Shopping List is a series of Offline First demo apps, each built using a different stack. These demo apps cover Progressive Web Apps, **hybrid mobile apps**, **native mobile apps**, and even a **desktop app**. These demo apps serve as reference implementations, live demos, tutorials, and workshops. Shopping List is a simple demo app, with a limited feature set including the ability create shopping lists, create shopping list items, and check off shopping list items in a shopping list.

Shopping List demo apps have been built using Vanilla JS, Polymer, React, Preact, Vue.js, Ember.js, React Native, Ionic, Cordova, Swift, Kotlin, and Electron. For the data layer, the demo apps use PouchDB or Cloudant Sync to store data locally on the device. This data can then be replicated with IBM Cloudant or Apache CouchDB.
