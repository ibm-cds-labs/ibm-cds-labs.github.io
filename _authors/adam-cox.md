[Experimental physicist](https://arxiv.org/find/grp_cs,grp_physics/1/OR+OR+au:+Cox_G_A+au:+Cox_Mobrand_G_A+au:+Collaboration_SNO/0/1/0/all/0/1?skip=0&query_id=b11d0600788000a1) (neutrino physics and direct dark matter detection) with experience in all aspects of constructing large hardware and software projects, including system design and integration, hardware design, hardware programming, system commissioning and calibration, software engineering, data management and analysis. As a physicist, I have a strong educational background in statistics, data analysis techniques, and working with large data sets that are relevant to today's machine learning and data science fields. As a Developer Advocate I build interesting data science projects for citizen scientists utilizing IBM Cloud technologies. I am also the co-founder of the [Seattle Deep Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Deep-Learning-Meetup/).
